## This document isn't finished. 
## Stay tuned


First of all you need checkout the sources and install needed ruby gems:

# git clone https://github.com/yast/yast--.git

Follow the README file, doc/architecture.txt document and install needed dependencies:

# sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/openSUSE_11.4/devel:languages:ruby:extensions.repo
# sudo zypper in rubygem-ruby-augeas rubygem-open4 rubygem-packaging_rake_tasks rubygem-ruby-dbus

Run rake install from the yast-- directory:
# sudo rake install

Run an example:
# ./yast++lib-country/examples/keyboard_conf


It's time to write your own yast++ module now. We'll start with the config_agent, the low level part:

# mkdir config_agent-windowmanager
# cd config_agent-windowmanager

Use config agent generator to generate the skeleton for your code:

# config-agent-generator file /etc/sysconfig/windowmanager

Add some lines of code to the skelleton:
# vi services/config_agent_service/windowmanager.rb
(TODO read function)

for debugging see: /var/log/configagent-service*
